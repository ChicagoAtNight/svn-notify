= Trac-Style Log Message Formatting =

This "commit" demonstrates how log messages look when they are written in [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting Trac wiki syntax] and converted to HTML by `[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SVN::Notify::Filter::Trac SVN::Notify::Filter::Trac]`. All of the various features of that syntax are demonstrated here.

I expect that there will soon be filters for [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ Markdown], [http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ Textile], [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlpod POD], and other formatting paradigms. Hopefully, most of the HTML generated by parsing those other syntaxes into HTML will look just as good, mainly because I'm not doing anything special: this is just plain 'ole HTML. But if I've missed something, do [https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Create.html?Queue=SVN-Notify let me know].

{{{
package SVN::Notify::Filter::Trac;

SVN::Notify->register_attributes( trac_url => 'trac-url=s' );

sub log_message {
    my ($notify, $lines) = @_;
    return $lines unless $notify->content_type eq 'text/html';

== Escaping Links and !WikiPageNames ==

This paragraph has what appears to be a !TracLink, because of the camel-casing of "!TracLink", but it's not a link, is it?

== Miscellaneous ==

Four or more dashes will be replaced by a horizontal line (<HR>). You know, like this:

Cool, eh? So that's about it. Enjoy!
